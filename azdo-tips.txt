From https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VSTeam/7.2.0
Install-Module -Name VSTeam -RequiredVersion 7.2.0

Import-Module VSTeam
Set-VSTeamAccount -Account <organization> -PersonalAccessToken <PAT>

Check authentication works
Show-VSTeam

In my case my Azure Devops instance is at https://dev.azure.com/hvl71/AzureDevOpsTestRun.
Obviously the personal access token (PAT) should be kept strictly secret since it's as efficient as your normal login.
You can get your PAT from your profile on Azure Devops (upper right corner, when logged-in, reduce rights and validity to a minimum)

In my case I connect using the below command (is the account param a little misleading? Some places it will be called organization instead. Which is most correct?): 
Set-VSTeamAccount -Account hvl71 -PersonalAccessToken <PAT>

These simple commands can be used to check access:
Show-VSTeam
Get-VSTeam -ProjectName AzureDevOpsTestRun

To test a Azure Devops pipeline without pushing or executing it run this type of command:
Test-VSTeamYamlPipeline [[-PipelineId] <Int32>] [-FilePath <String>] -ProjectName <String> [<CommonParameters>]
